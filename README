django-easy-pages strikes a ballance between the simplicity of flatpages and the power of a full-fledged CMS.

It offers pages composed of one or more content blocks, handles embedding of media, auto-generates menus and also allows individual content blocks to be used within pages generated by other views.

A Page object can be either injected into every ContextResponse using a context processor, or can be accessed in individual pages using a template tag.

When rendering a response that isn't registered as a page itself, a dummy page object is returned that offers some of the interfaces.

Caching greatly enhances performance. 




##Page Types

###Content Pages

ContentBlock with ContentBlockType "main" (which is the only one automatically created) is given special consideration
